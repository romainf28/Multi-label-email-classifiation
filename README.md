# Multi-label-email-classifiation

This repo contains the implementation of a multi label classifier able to classify emails into one or several of eight classes (based on the metadata extracted from the email, such as mail type, number of images in the body, number of urls in the body, etc) with a Random Forest Classifier. A version using a neural network is also available.
